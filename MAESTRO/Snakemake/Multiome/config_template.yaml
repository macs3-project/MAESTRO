# Whether or not to run RSeQC for RNA sequencing. [True, False]

# By default, the pipeline will skip the RSeQC part. DEFAULT: False.

# Whether or not to provide custom peaks. [False, True]
# If custompeaks is set as True, users need to provide the file location of peak file through custompeaksloc

# By default (False), the pipeline will use the peaks called using MACS2. DEFAULT: False.

# Whether or not to call peaks from short fragments (shorter than 150bp). [True, False]
# If it's set as True, MAESTRO will merge the peaks called from all fragments and those called from short fragments,
# and then use the merged peak file for further analysis.
# If not (by default), the pipeline will only use peaks called from all fragments.
shortpeaks: {{ shortpeaks }}

# Whether or not to call peaks by cluster [True, False]
# If it's set True, MAESTRO will split the bam file according to clustering result, and then call peaks for each cluster.
# By default (not set), MAESTRO will skip this step.

# The RP model to use to calaculate gene score for scATAC-seq. [Simple, Enhanced]
# For each gene, simple model sums over the impact of all regulatory elements within the up/dowm-stream of TSS.
# On the basis of simple model, enhanced model gives the regulatory elements within the exon region a higher weight,
# and also excludes the regulatory elements overlapped with another gene (the promoter and exon of a nearby gene).
# See the MAESTRO paper for more details. DEFAULT: Enhanced.

# Method to annotate cell types for scATAC-seq [RP-based, peak-based, both].
# MAESTRO provides two strategies to annotate cell types for scATAC-seq data.
# Users can choose from 'RP-based' and 'peak-based', or choose to run both of them.
# One is based on gene regulatory potential predicted by RP model. Another is based on the bulk chromatin accessibility data from Cistrome database.
# If 'RP-based' is set, MAESTRO performs the cell-type annotation using the gene regulatory potential to represent gene expression,
# and the logFC of gene regulatory potential between one cluster and all the other cells is used to calculate the gene signature scores.
# If 'peak-based' is set, MAESTRO utilizes GIGGLE to evaluate the enrichment of bulk chromatin accessibility peaks on cluster-specific peaks from scATAC-seq data,
# and then transfers the Cistrome cluster identity from the most enriched bulk chromatin accessibility data as the cell-type annotation for the scATAC-seq cluster.
# See the MAESTRO paper for more details. DEFAULT: RP-based.
method: {{ method }}

# Cell signature file used to annotate cell types. MAESTRO provides several sets of built-in cell signatures.
# Users can choose from ['human.immune.CIBERSORT', 'mouse.brain.ALLEN', 'mouse.all.facs.TabulaMuris', 'mouse.all.droplet.TabulaMuris'].
# Custom cell signatures are also supported. In this situation, users need to provide the file location of cell signatures,
# and the signature file is tab-seperated without header. The first column is cell type, and the second column is signature gene.
